<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="indent">The writer of the following pages has been
in the habit, for many years, of amusing himself
with the composition of Poetry. Often
has he been advised by his friends to publish;
and at length, influenced by their persuasion,
and feeling a sort of paternal fondness for the
offspring of his own brain, he ventures to
present this small volume to the notice of
the Public.</p>

<p class="indent">It contains Poems of many different kinds,
composed, of course, in as many varieties of
style; and the author has exerted his best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
endeavours to render them worthy of approbation.
The present times&mdash;he is well aware&mdash;are
unfavourable for the publication of poetical
works. The booksellers complain generally
of the little demand for them. Nevertheless,
it is very improbable that Poetry,&mdash;if excellent,
(as it ought to be to deserve the name,)
should ever be totally neglected. The seed
of poetic taste is sown by the hand of Nature
in the souls of all men; though in a small
number only it is by culture brought to
maturity.</p>

<p class="indent">The author has exalted ideas of Poetry,
He deems it&mdash;decidedly&mdash;the first of the Fine
Arts. It is the most intellectual,&mdash;the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
comprehensive,&mdash;the most powerful,&mdash;the most
delightful,&mdash;and, also,&mdash;hear it, Utilitarians!&mdash;the
most useful. In remote antiquity, as is
well known, it was chiefly instrumental in
teaching and civilising the then-barbarous
human race. To lure their wild minds into
reflection, it invested truth and morality with
the many-coloured garb of Fiction, and introduced
them, through their delighted imagination,
to their understanding and their heart;
while, by the charm of harmonious numbers,
it soothed their fierce and licentious passions
into submission to the laws of social life. It
was believed to have something divine in its
nature, and was universally held in the highest
veneration. From ancient times, even to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
day, it has continued to be a favourite study
with many of the most illustrious characters.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally,&mdash;and let this be for ever remembered,
as conferring on it the highest honour!
Poetry has been deemed worthy by the Sacred
Writers to be made an instrument in the cause
of Religion; and by its sublime descriptions
it has assisted human imagination in forming
grand, and awful conceptions of the Almighty
Creator!</p>

<span class="i10">Hark! Zephyr wakes, and sweetly-whispering, tells</span>
<span class="i10">The approach of Eve; already Nature feels</span>

<span class="i10">The fields, the trees, imbibe the cool, moist air,</span>
<span class="i10">Their feverish thirst allay, and smile revived.</span>
<span class="i10">The Soul, too, feels her influence, sweetly soothed</span>
<span class="i10">Into a tender calm. O! let us now,</span>

<span class="i10">Say, do they not, in figure, motion, hue,</span>
<span class="i10">Resemble the sea-waves at misty dawn?</span>
<span class="i10">What shadowy shape along the troubled lake</span>

<span class="i10">Imagination views with sweet surprise</span>
<span class="i10">The unknown appearance&mdash;breathless in suspense.</span>
<span class="i10">The Spirit of the waters can it be,</span>
<span class="i10">On his aerial car? some fairy Power?</span>
<span class="i10">Pants not thy heart, Louisa, half-alarm'd?</span>
<span class="i10">It grows upon the sight,&mdash;strange, watery sounds</span>
<span class="i10">Attend its course;&mdash;hark! was not that a voice?</span>
<span class="i10">O! 'tis a fishing-boat!&mdash;its sails and oars</span>
<span class="i10">I now discern. The church-clock strikes! how loud</span>
<span class="i10">Burst forth its sound into the startled air,</span>
<span class="i10">That feels it still, and trembles far around!</span>
<span class="i10">My dearest Love! it summons us away;</span>
<span class="i10">The dew begins to fall; let us depart:</span>
<span class="i10">How sweetly have we spent this evening-hour!</span>
